    "<h2>Appendix 13 - Location Inference, Verifying DC Outlier</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple program to select a random sample of tweets that our location algorithm determined to come from users based in Washington DC, which will be used to manually check our location inferrence method. 601 tweets are sampled, representing 5% of tweets assigned to DC in total.\n",
    "\n",
    "Manual reading of the 601 location fields found 55 ambiguous assignements and 1 false assignement. This represents a 90.7% success rate for the tested sample if we reject ambiguous locations, or 99.8% if we reject only strictly false state assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Ambiguous Location Fields</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "The 55 ambiguous location fields can be seen below. These all contain multiple states or cities, including DC, and in some cases include a location outside the United States.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a pair of factors at play here: DC is a commuter city in which many people from surrounding and north-eastern states work; and where users have listed the acronyms for multiple states, the algorithm picks DC when DC is the first state alphabetically. States such as DC that are high in the alphabete are likely assigned to a disproportionate number of ambiguous location fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Incorrectly Assigned States</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "The 1 incorrectly assigned location fields can be seen below. It reads \"ANTI DC\", which the algorith has assigned to DC\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Bearing on DC Tweets-To-Population Outlier</h3>\n",
    "9.2% of the sampled tweets assigned to DC were in fact ambiguous, containing multiple locations including DC. Earlier testing showed about 0.9% of all tweets were ambiguously assigned. Taking both samples to be representative, tweets assigned to DC are 8.3% more likely to be ambiguous than a typical tweet. However, DC's tweet-to-population ratio is roughly 50 times higher than the average for other states. This difference is too great to be explained by an 8.3% difference in ambiguous location fields assigned to DC, and suggests that DC is a true outlier in tweets-to-population ratio."
